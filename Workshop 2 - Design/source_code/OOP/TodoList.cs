        //        The following requirements are to be met:

        // Create a new member with a name, personal number, a unique member id should be created and assigned to the new member.
        // List all members in two different ways:
        // “Compact List”; name, member id and number of boats
        // “Verbose List”; name, personal number, member id and boats with boat information
        // Delete a member
        // Change a member’s information
        // Look at a specific member’s information
        // Register a new boat for a member the boat should have a type(Sailboat, Motorsailer, kayak/Canoe, Other) and a length.
        // Deleta a boat
        // Change a boat’s information
        // Persistence(the registry should be saved and loaded for example from a text file.)
        // Strict Model-View separation(The model should not depend on the view or user interface in any way(direct or indirect) the user interface (view) should not implement domain functionality)
        // Good quality of code(for example naming, standards, duplication)
        // An object oriented design and implementation.This includes but is not limited to:
        // Objects are connected using associations and not with keys/ids.
        // Classes have high cohesion and are not too large or have too much responsibility.
        // Classes have low coupling and are not too connected to other entities.
        // Avoid the use of static variables or operations as well as global variables.
        // Avoid hidden dependencies.
        // Informations should be encapsulated.
        // Use a natural design, the domain model should inspire the design.
        // Simple error handling.The application should not crash but it does not need to be user friendly.
        // Participate in the peer review process


        //Spara exemplet hur man gör en count här
