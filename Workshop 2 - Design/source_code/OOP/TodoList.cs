        // An object oriented design and implementation.This includes but is not limited to:
        // Objects are connected using associations and not with keys/ids.
        // Classes have high cohesion and are not too large or have too much responsibility.
        // Classes have low coupling and are not too connected to other entities.
        // Avoid the use of static variables or operations as well as global variables.
        // Avoid hidden dependencies.
        // Informations should be encapsulated.
        // Simple error handling.The application should not crash but it does not need to be user friendly.
